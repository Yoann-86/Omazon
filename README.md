## Frontend architecture: 

To build this fake e-shop, I used React with TypeScript and Sass for styling. The application fetches data from an homemade API and renders it in a Single Page Application (SPA) format. The design and layout are based on a Figma mockup that guided the integration process.


## Backend architecture:

The backend is a custom-built API designed to serve data to the frontend. It is developed using Node.js with TypeScript for strong typing and Express.js as the framework for routing and handling HTTP requests. MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage product information. The API exposes endpoints for CRUD operations and is integrated with authentication and security features to ensure safe data transactions. Docker is used for containerization, facilitating easy deployment and scalability.

⚠️ My backend server is not running 24/7. It's a server made available by my school, I have to start it manually every day, then it is active for 8 hours.

## Objective:

I created this project to practice and showcase my skills building fullstack web applications using TypeScript. This project was developed in my free time, and I plan to continually enhance it with new features.

## What I learned

I took my time on this project to explore some tools. I learned to use Redux to manage the states of my application and I find it to be a great tool. I also learned to use mongoDB with mongoose on this project, me who was used to relational databases. I was especially able to push my use of github workflows and docker a little further. There is still a lot to do on this project, I think I will come back to it a little later. I have to go and improve myself on other projects and other technologies.
